- Merged 4.14.176
- Merged security patches (Android April 2020)
- Merged LA.UM.8.1.r1-14700-sm8150.0 tag
- HentaiOS users (and probably other DyneOEM Roms users) may encounter issues turning on Wi-Fi, workaround is to run "echo ON > /dev/wlan" with root privileges, FKM does that just fine
- A LOT of other changes since last stable release
- Still better BB than stock kernel ;-)
